What is activity?

Activity is that we had to scrap the github
-> First we get a url ("https://github.com/topics")
-> we had to request this and had to ge the three topics got after hitting this url
-> Then we had to go to each topic and get its first 8 repos link
-> Then we had to create folder of each topic
-> and store json file in folder which is named with basename of links of repos of that particular topic
-> and then going to issues link and then finding the link and name of every issue.
